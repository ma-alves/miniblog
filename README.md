# miniblog (WIP)
A mini blog project based on MDN DIY Django challenge. After finishing the server-side django module we were challenged to create a mini blog featuring all their requirements using the knowledge we've picked up. Users can create, edit, and delete their own posts, as well as like and comment on the posts of others.

## Tech Stack
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - Web Framework
